                    This week I created the website and github page for the project. Additionally, I created the github repo for the rstudio project. I installed the AoT client library and started working with the data. 
                    I created functions to get the most recent nodes with data avaliable to add to the map. I also created new dataframes to extract the latitue and longitude from the geometry.locations frame.

                        This week I created the base layout for the map, the heatmap, and comparison tabs for the AOT data.
                        Also created checkbox options for user to choose what AOT they wat do view both in the main tab and in the node comparison tab.
                        Created temporary location place holders in the comparison tab for all pollutants in AOT.

                     This week I added the nodes to the map and implemented the address to show when the marker is selected and the ID shows when you hover. I also created a function to get the data for the line charts and tables for the AoT. I made all the functions thus far reactive to the pollutants selected. 
                     I also added code to make the data update every minute. I then implemented the map marker clicked to show the data for that node being selected. 
                     The line chart then displays for the current time and the table displays. I implemented the 24 hours and 7 days worth of data for each graphical and tabular representation. I made the data reactive to the current/24 hours and 7 days input.
                     I implemented the node comparisons data for the line charts and tables. I then put this data into the line chart and table renders. I made these reactive as well to what was selected and the timespan requested.

                         This week I created reactive checkboxes for all the AOT, Dark Sky and Open AQ data 
                         (along with the reactive call function to check what was clicked).
                         Created a 2 line Graphs for node comparison, and rearanged the location and view of pollutant tables in the node comparison.
                         Created table tabs for the tables for comparing nodes, and added a new side menu option of choosing a time frame of data to view.

                       This week I implemented the darksky data for the line chart and the table for when a node is selected on the map. I made it reactive to display current, 24 hours and 7 days worth of data.
                       I also implemented the heatmap for AoT and Darksky. I then made these reactive to the inputs selected and the current/ 7 days and 24 hours.

                         This week I reorganized the whole side bar menu so that it not only fits on the EVL but also more user friendly, put tabs in to subtabs to separate
                         dashboards from parameter options.
                         Also created the reactive table and line for the dark sky data, along with creating a filter function that cleans up the incoming Dark sky data so that 
                         the data is filtered to the users timeframe preference, and parameters chosen. this data is then additionally filltered for the line graph.
                         Choose a color blind friendly pallet.

                     This week I implemented the imperial to metric conversion for all of the data. I also started working with the open aq API. I was able to get the data to add the markers to the map for this api.
                     I then added the open aq data to the heatmap and made this reactive to the current 7 days and 24 hours. I also made it reactive to the inputs selected for the heatmap.
                     I also implemented the on marker selected for the open aq data and put this data into the line chart and table plots. 
                     I also made this reactive to the parameters selected and the current/24 hours and 7 days.

                         This week I created reactive radio buttons that go with the heat map so that the user can only choose one type of parameter from each group, 
                         with addition options beign reactive to a users choce of AOT/Dark Sky/openOQ.
                         Also cleaned up the titles for tables and created a reactive title that changes based on what point a user chooses from the map.
                         Made it so that the table/linegraphs that don't pertain to the point chosen are blank, and not showing other node data.
                         Cleaned up layout so it fits the EVL screen, and conforms to the touchable standards.
                         Removed options for user to search in data tables, to save space and touchablility.
                         fixed issuse with map nodes not being labeled correctly.
